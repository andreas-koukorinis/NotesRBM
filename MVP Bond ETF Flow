 Strategy - Simplified Version
Core Concept
Track the 20 most liquid bond ETFs and their top 50 holdings to identify flow-driven opportunities.
1. Data Collection (Manual/Semi-Automated)
What You Need:

ETF Holdings: Download daily holdings from ETF provider websites (iShares, Vanguard, SPDR)
Bond Prices: Use FINRA TRACE for free end-of-day prices
Basic Reference Data: Pull from Bloomberg/Reuters terminal once weekly

MVP Approach:

Focus on just 5 major ETFs initially: AGG, LQD, HYG, TLT, IEF
Track only their top 50 holdings (covers ~70% of AUM)
Use daily snapshots instead of intraday data
Store in simple CSV files with date stamps

2. Flow Calculation (Excel/Python Script)
Simplified Method:

Daily Flow = (Today's ETF Holding - Yesterday's ETF Holding) / Bond Outstanding Amount
Ignore complex decomposition initially
Just track "Total Flow" as single metric

MVP Calculation:
For each bond:
  1. Sum holdings across all 5 ETFs
  2. Calculate day-over-day change
  3. Divide by bond's total outstanding
  4. Save 20-day rolling sum
3. Signal Generation (Basic Statistics)
Simple Signal:

Calculate 20-day flow for each bond
Compute mean and standard deviation over past 6 months
Generate z-score: (Current Flow - Mean) / StdDev
Buy Signal: Z-score < -2 (heavy outflows)
Sell Signal: Z-score > +2 (heavy inflows)
No Signal: Otherwise

MVP Output: Daily CSV with [Date, CUSIP, Flow Z-Score, Signal]
4. Portfolio Construction (Rule-Based)
Simple Rules:

Maximum 10 positions (5 long, 5 short)
Equal weight within each side (20% each)
Only trade bonds with >$500M outstanding
Only trade investment grade bonds initially
Hold positions for exactly 20 days, then re-evaluate

MVP Portfolio:

Morning: Run signal calculation
Select top 5 negative z-scores for longs
Select top 5 positive z-scores for shorts
Rebalance monthly to minimize trading

5. Risk Management (Basic Limits)
Simplified Controls:

No single bond > 2% of portfolio
No sector > 30% of portfolio
Portfolio duration must be +/- 1 year of AGG
Stop loss at -3% per position
Maximum 100% gross exposure (50% long, 50% short)

MVP Monitoring: Daily Excel sheet tracking positions vs limits
6. Execution (Manual Trading)
Practical Approach:

Trade through institutional broker with bond desk
Use limit orders at mid-market
Accept wider spreads for simplicity
Trade only at month-end to minimize costs
Size trades at $100K minimum for liquidity

MVP Execution Log: Track [Date, CUSIP, Direction, Size, Price, Spread Paid]
7. Performance Tracking (Spreadsheet)
Basic Metrics:

Daily P&L by position
Monthly return calculation
Simple Sharpe ratio
Win rate (% profitable trades)
Average bid-ask spread paid

MVP Dashboard: Single Excel sheet with charts updated daily
8. Initial Testing Phase
Paper Trading First:

Run system for 3 months on paper
Track hypothetical signals and returns
Validate flow calculations against actual ETF trades
Refine z-score thresholds based on results

Technology Stack for MVP
Minimal Requirements:

Python: Basic pandas for data processing
Excel: Portfolio tracking and risk monitoring
FINRA TRACE: Free bond price data
ETF Websites: Daily holdings data
Email: Alerts for signals and limits

Daily Workflow (2-3 hours):

9:00 AM: Download ETF holdings (30 min)
9:30 AM: Run Python script for flows (15 min)
9:45 AM: Update Excel portfolio tracker (15 min)
10:00 AM: Review signals and limits (30 min)
10:30 AM: Place orders if rebalancing (30 min)
End of Day: Update performance tracker (30 min)

Key Simplifications

No Complex Decomposition: Just track total flows
No Regression Analysis: Use simple z-scores
No Optimization: Equal weight positions
Limited Universe: Only 250 bonds (50 per ETF Ã— 5 ETFs)
Monthly Rebalancing: Reduce transaction costs
Manual Processes: Avoid complex automation initially

Success Metrics for MVP
Month 1-3 Goals:

Successfully track flows for 250 bonds daily
Generate signals with <1% error rate
Execute paper trades within 10 bps of mid
Achieve positive Sharpe ratio in backtest

Month 4-6 Goals:

Go live with $1-2M test capital
Achieve 80% signal accuracy
Maintain risk limits without breaches
Generate positive returns after costs

Expansion Path
Once MVP is stable:

Add more ETFs (expand to 20)
Include high yield bonds
Automate data collection
Add regression-based signals
Implement proper optimization
Build real-time monitoring
